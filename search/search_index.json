Each of these videos is several minutes long and has a category and an associated file containing annotations in sign language (ELAN file). For example, the video file CLSFB - 01 ok/CLSFBI0103_S001_B.mp4 has CLSFB - 01 ok as a category and an associated ELAN annotation file CLSFBI0103.eaf . The annotation list As explained above, each video has associated annotations. However, in addition to the ELAN file, a CSV file with the list of annotations and their start and end is provided. The annotations are separated according to the hand used. For example, features/annotations/CLSFB - 01 ok/CLSFBI0103A_S001_B.mp4/right_hand.csv is an annotation file for the right hand of the video for the right hand of the video CLSFBI0103A_S001_B.mp4 . Columns in an annotation file (CSV) start : the start of the annotation (in milliseconds) end : the end of the annotation (in milliseconds) word : the annotation, e.g. HOUSE(1X) Extracted landmarks From each frame of each video a set of landmarks is extracted. These landmarks relate to the main speaker in the video. Here are the different sets of landmarks extracted: The face The pose (skeleton) The hands This very precise data is then aggregated into another set of landmarks, the holistic landmarks. These are also offered in a cleaned version where an interpolation phase and a smoothing phase have been performed. For example, the video CLSFB - 01 ok/CLSFBI0103_S001_B.mp4 has several associated landmarks in the folder features/landmarks/CLSFB - 01 ok/CLSFBI0103A_S001_B.mp4 : face.csv : the face landmarks pose.csv : pose, skeleton landmarks hands.csv : hand landmarks holistic.csv : holistic landmarks holistic_cleaned.csv : holistic cleaned landmarks Face landmarks There are 468 facial landmarks (numbered from 0 to 467). The corresponding CSV file therefore has 2x468 (for X and Y respectively) or 936 columns. Let FACE_0_X, FACE_0_Y, FACE_1_X, FACE_1_Y, ... , FACE_467_X, FACE_467_Y, . Skeleton landmarks The pose landmarks are 33 in number (numbered 0 to 32). The corresponding CSV file therefore has 2x33 (for X and Y respectively) or 66 columns. In order to identify the part of the body concerned, please refer to the image below. The columns are in the same order as in the image and are in capitals. So: NOSE_X, NOSE_Y, LEFT_EYE_INNER_X, LEFT_EYE_INNER_Y, ..., RIGHT_FOOT_INDEX_X, RIGHT_FOOT_INDEX_Y . Hand landmarks The hand landmarks are primarily for the right hand, and then the left hand. Each hand has 21 landmarks (numbered from 0 to 20). Each landmark consists of an X position and a Y position. This makes a total of (2 hands) x (21 landmarks) x (2 dimensions), or 84 columns. The column names are in upper case and are ordered first by hand, then by the name of the landmark in the image below, and finally by X and Y. This gives: RIGHT_WRIST_X, RIGHT_WRIST_Y, ..., RIGHT_PINKY_TIP_X, RIGHT_PINKY_TIP_Y, LEFT_WRIST_X, LEFT_WRIST_Y, ..., LEFT_PINKY_TIP_X, LEFT_PINKY_TIP_Y Holistic landmarks There are 5 holistic landmarks: the face (FACE): the average of the face landmarks the right hand (RIGHT_HAND): the average of the right hand landmarks left hand (LEFT_HAND): the average of the left hand landmarks right shoulder (RIGHT_SHOULDER): the right shoulder marker the left shoulder (LEFT_SHOULDER): the left shoulder marker These landmarks are separated into two dimensions (X and Y). So there are 10 columns in the CSV file: `FACE_X,FACE_Y,RIGHT_HAND_X,RIGHT_HAND_Y,LEFT_HAND_X,LEFT_HAND_Y,RIGHT_SHOULDER_X,RIGHT_SHOULDER_Y,LEFT_SHOULDER_X,LEFT_SHOULDER_Y A file that links videos to their features In addition to the features discussed above. A videos.csv file is a list of videos with information about them and paths to their features. Each row is for one video. Here are the different columns in this file: filename : the name of the video file (e.g. CLSFBI0103_S001_B.mp4 ) category : the category of the video (e.g. CLSFB - 01 ok ) filepath : the relative path of the video (eg videos\\CLSFB - 01 ok\\CLSFBI0103A_S001_B.mp4 ) frames : the number of frames in the video (ex: 25274 ) right_hand_annotations : the relative path of the right hand annotations left_hand_annotations : the relative path of the left hand annotations face_positions : the relative path of the face landmarks hands_positions: the relative path of the hand landmarks pose_positions : the relative path of the skeleton landmarks holistic_features : the relative path of the holistic landmarks holistic_features_cleaned : the relative path of the cleaned holistic landmarks The two first columns are mandatory.
